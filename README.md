Now enjoy playing the game!

## Rules
By default there are 4 players.
Each player take terms in picking two cards.
Only scores when the two cards match perfectly, and this player can continue playing, otherwise, these two cards will face down and the game will switch to the next player - everyone needs to memorise the cards in order to score! All scores are recorded in the board.

* Not matched (nothing matching ➡️ not scoring, switch to next player)

* Matched! (Scoring 1 point, and this player continues to play🙌🏼)

* Partially match (only matches number or colour; not scoring ➡️ switch to next player)

The game finishes when all cards are matched💯✨. According to Wikipedia, on average, it takes 44 times to finish a deck of 52 cards (without jokers). Good luck on playing🚀! 

## Development
I coded this little game in a weekend☕️. A good practice for using JPanel and java application designs. Right now this version has a set value of 4 players with a deck of 2-coloured cards. Next step would be taking inputs from users to decide the number of players, ways of colouring (either 2-coloured or 4-coloured), and the number of decks.
